# SearchBar-Animation

Simple search bar animation which I took inspiration from a Lottie File animation I saw. I have improved it by have the cancel
button enter by rotation as well as making the background opacity increase as the keyboard shows. This was done so that
the search bar was made the most relevant feature in the view.

There is still a bug which remains, when dismissing the search bar with the cancel button however this is something I will fix
if anyone is actually interested in using this. 

If they are then simply Star the repo and I will then make sure to rectify any bugs.
